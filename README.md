# IoT Network Traffic Analysis during DoS Attacks

This project focuses on analyzing the network traffic generated by IoT devices during Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The primary goal is to identify and understand the patterns and behaviors associated with this traffic, including protocol usage, packet sizes, and communication frequencies.

## Dataset

The dataset used is a 5% subset of the Bot-IoT dataset, downloaded from Kaggle. It consists of 1,000,000 rows of data and exclusively captures DoS traffic.

## Analysis

Analysis was performed directly on the CSV file using the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `pyplot`

The data was then converted into pcap file format to ensure compatibility with Wireshark.

## Key Analyses

- **Sankey Diagram**: Visual representation of traffic flow and protocol usage.
- **Traffic Volume Over Time**: Analysis of traffic volume trends over a specified period.
- **Entropy Volume Over Time**: Analysis of entropy changes in the traffic over time.
- **Network Graph Analysis**: Visualization of the network graph to understand communication patterns.
- **Z-Score Distribution of Packets**: Statistical analysis of packet data to identify anomalies.
- **Wireshark Protocol Hierarchy**: Detailed breakdown of protocols used in the traffic.
- **Wireshark Conversation Data**: Analysis of conversation data captured by Wireshark.

## Technologies Used

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib` & `pyplot`: For data visualization.
- `Wireshark`: For packet analysis.

## Installation

To run the analysis, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
